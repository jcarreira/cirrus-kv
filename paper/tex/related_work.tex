\paragraph{Remote memory management} Systems like RAMCloud~\cite{ramcloud} and FaRM~\cite{farm} provide efficient access to remote memory to applications. RAMCloud provides a key-value store interface, while FaRM a transactional interface. \System borrows some lessons from these systems and makes aggressive use of RDMA to improve CPU utilization and achieve high network performance. However, \System does not constrain applications and focus on how to manage bare data movement between the small memory in the compute nodes and the memory blades efficiently.

\paragraph{Hardware support for disaggregation}

\paragraph{PGAS}
