\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we have presented \System, a system that provides memory disaggregation for a disaggregated datacenter. \System is responsible for managing the allocation of memory resources, enforcing access controls and resource isolation. It also provides an efficient user-space API to expose remote memory to applications.
