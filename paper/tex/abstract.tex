Disaggregated memory will soon become a reality with multiple prototypes being currently developed by both companies and research institutions. Disaggregated memory provides compelling advantages in the context of datacenters: lower energy usage, better resource utilization and lower TCO.

%However, the adoption of memory disaggregation 

%However, the adoption of memory disaggregation is currently gated on the performance of the access path from applications to the large pools of remote memory.

%Rather than network latency/bandwidth, the performance of disaggregated memory architectures based on virtual memory systems with stock operating systems is poor and inadequate to the high-performance needs of this architecture.

In this paper we propose \System\footnote{tentative name}, a system for memory disaggregation support in warehouse-scale computers. \System provides basic primitives for allocation and management of data resources in the datacenter. The system consists of three main components: a simple user-space API for remote memory access, a centralized manager for resource allocation and access control and a memory blade controller that manages and makes memory visible within memory blades.
